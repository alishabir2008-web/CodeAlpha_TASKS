  # Task 4: Object Detection and Tracking

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of Task 4 of the CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship.
The objective of this task is to implement real-time object detection and tracking using computer vision and AI techniques.

The system detects objects from a live webcam feed and assigns unique tracking IDs to each detected object, allowing them to be tracked consistently across video frames.

🎯 Objectives

Set up real-time video input using a webcam

Detect objects using a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLO)

Draw bounding boxes and labels on detected objects

Track objects across frames using the SORT tracking algorithm

Display detection and tracking results in real time

⚙️ How It Works

The webcam captures real-time video frames

Each frame is passed to the YOLO model for object detection

Detected objects are represented with bounding boxes

SORT assigns a unique ID to each object

Objects are tracked smoothly across consecutive frames

The final output is displayed with labels and tracking IDs
